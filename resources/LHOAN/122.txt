All that I am, all that I do,
all that I’ll ever have, I offer now to you.
Take and sanctify these gifts
for your glory Lord.
Knowing that I love and serve you
is enough reward.
All that I am, all that I do,
all that I’ll ever have I offer now to you.

All that I dream, all that I pray,
all that I’ll ever make I give to you today.
Take and sanctify these gifts
for your honour, Lord.
Knowing that I love and serve you
is enough reward.
All that I am, all that I do, all that I’ll ever
have I offer now to you.
