[Follow me, follow me,
leave your home and family,
leave your fishing nets
and boats upon the shore.
Leave the seed you have sown,
leave the crops that youâ€™ve grown,
leave the people you have known
and follow me.]

The Foxes have their holes
and the swallows have their nests,
but the Son of Man has
no place to lie down,
I do not offer comfort,
I do not offer wealth,
but in me will all happiness
be found.

If you would follow me,
you must leave old ways behind.
You must take my cross and
follow on my path.
You may be far from loved ones,
you may be far from home,
but my Father will welcome
you at last.

Although I go away
you will never be alone,
for the Spirit will be there
to comfort you.
Though all of you may scatter,
each follow his own path,
still the Spirit of love
will lead you home.
