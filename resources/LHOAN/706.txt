[Walk with me, O my Lord,
through the darkest night and brightest day.
Be at my side, O Lord,
hold my hand and guide me on my way.]

Sometimes the road seems long,
my energy is spent.
Then, Lord, I think of you
and I am given strength.

Stones often bar my path
and there are times I fall,
but you are always there
to help me when I call.

Just as you calmed the wind
and walked upon the sea,
conquer, my living Lord,
the storms that threaten me.

Help me to pierce the mists
that cloud my heart and mind,
so that I shall not fear
the steepest mountain-side.

As once you healed the lame
and gave sight to the blind,
help me when I'm downcast
to hold my head up high.
