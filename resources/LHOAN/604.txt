Seek ye first the kingdom of God,
and his righteousness,
and all these things shall be added unto you;
allelu, alleluia.

[Alleluia, alleluia,
alleluia, allelu, alleluia.]

You shall not live by bread alone,
but by every word
that proceeds from the mouth of God;
allelu, alleluia.

Ask and it shall be given unto you,
seek and ye shall find;
knock, and it shall be opened unto you;
allelu, alleluia.
