Will you come and follow me 
if I but call your name?
Will you go where you don’t know
and never be the same?
Will you let my love be shown,
will you let my name be known,
will you let my life be grown in you, 
and you in me?

Will you leave yourself behind
if I but call your name?
Will you care for cruel and kind, 
and never be the same?
Will you risk the hostile stare
should your life attract or scare,
will you let me answer prayer
in you, and you in me?

Will you let the blinded see
if I but call your name?
will you set the pris’ners free,
and never be the same?
will you kiss the leper clean
and do such as this unseen, 
and admit to what I mean
in you, and you in me? 

Will you love the ‘you’ you hide
if I but call your name?
Will you quell the fear inside,
and never be the same?
Will you use the faith you’ve found
to reshape the world around
through my sight and touch and
sound in you, and you in me?

Lord, your summons echoes true
when you but call my name.
Let me turn and follow you,
and never be the same.
In your company I'll go
where your love and footsteps show.
Thus I'll move and live and grow
in you, and you in me.
