[Unless a grain of wheat shall fall 
upon the ground and die,
it remains but a single grain with no life.]

If we have died with him,
then we shall live with him:
if we hold firm we shall reign with him.

If anyone serves me,
then they must follow me,
wherever I am my servants will be.

Make your home in me
as I make mine in you;
those who remain in me bear much fruit.

If you remain in me
and my word lives in you;
Then you will be my disciples.  

Those who love me
are loved by my Father;
we shall be with them and dwell in them.

Peace I leave with you,
my peace I give to you;
peace which the world cannot give is my gift.
