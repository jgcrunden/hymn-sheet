O Lord, all the world belongs to you,
and you are always making all things new.
What is wrong you forgive,
and the new life you give
is what's turning the world upside down.

The world's only loving to its friends,
but you have brought us love that never ends;
loving enemies too,
and this loving with you
is what's turning the world upside down.

This world lives divided and apart.
You draw us all together and we start,
in your body, to see
that in a fellowship we
can be turning the world upside down.

The world wants the wealth to live in state,
but you show us a new way to be great:
like a servant you came,
and if we do the same,
we'll be turning the world upside down.

O Lord, all the world belongs to you,
and you are always making all things new.
Send your Spirit on all
in your Church, whom you call
to be turning the world upside down.
