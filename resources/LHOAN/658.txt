[The Lord hears the cry of the poor.
Blessed be the Lord.]

I will bless the Lord at all times,
his praise ever in my mouth.
Let my soul glory in the Lord,
for he hears the cry of the poor.

Let the lowly hear and be glad:
the Lord listens to their pleas;
and to hearts broken he is near,
for he hears the cry of the poor.

Ev'ry spirit crushed he will save;
will be ransom for their lives;
will be safe shelter for their fears,
for he hears the cry of the poor.

We proclaim the greatness of God,
his praise ever in our mouth;
ev'ry face brightened in his light,
for he hears the cry of the poor.
