[O Lord, you are the centre of my life:
I will always praise you,
I will always serve you,
I will always keep you in my sight.]

Keep me safe, O God, I take refuge in you.
I say to the Lord, "You are my God.
My happiness lies in you alone;
My happiness lies in you alone."

I will bless the Lord who give me counsel,
who even at night directs my heart.
I keep the Lord ever in my sight:
since he is at my right hand, I shall stand firm.

So my heart rejoices, my soul is glad;
even in safety shall my body rest.
For you will not leave my soul among the dead,
nor let your beloved know decay.
