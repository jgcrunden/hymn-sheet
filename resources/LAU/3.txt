Soul of my Savior, sanctify my breast;
Body of Christ, be thou my saving guest;
Blood of my Savior, bathe me in thy tide;
Wash me with water flowing from his side.

Strength and protection may thy Passion be;
O Blessed Jesus, hear and answer me;
Deep in thy wounds, Lord, hide and shelter me;
So shall I never, never part from thee.

Hear me, Lord Jesus, listen as I pray;
"Lead me from night to never ending day.
Fill all the world with love and grace divine,
And glory, laud, and praise be ever thine."
