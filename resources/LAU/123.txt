Diverse in culture, nation, race,
we come together by your grace.
God let us be a meeting ground
where hope and healing love are found.

[This is a chorus
This is a chorus
This is a chorus
This is a chorus]

God, let us be a bridge of care
connecting people everywhere.
Help us confront all fear and hate
and lust for power that separate.

When chasms widen, storms arise,
O Holy Spirit, make us wise.
Let us resolve like steel be strong

God, let us be a table spread
with gifts of love and broken bread,
where all find welcome, grace attends
and enemies arise as friends
