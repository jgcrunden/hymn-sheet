Shepherd of souls, in love come feed us
life-giving bread for hungry hearts.
To those refreshing waters lead us
where dwells that grace your peace imparts.
May we, the wayward in your fold,
by your forgiveness rest consoled.

Life-giving vine, come, feed and nourish,
strengthen each branch with life divine.
Ever in you, O may we flourish,
fruitful the branches of the vine.
Lord, may our souls be purified
so that in Christ we may abide.

Following you, O Lord, who led them,
multitudes thronged the mountainside;
filled with compassion, Lord, you fed them,
fed them with loaves you multiplied.
Come, feed us now, O Lord, we pray:
life-giving bread give us this day.

Father, who fed the Hebrew nations,
giving them manna from the sky,
give now the bread of our salvation
that we who eat shall never die.
We are your people, God, in need;
may we be on living bread now feed.

Help us, dear Lord, prepare a dwelling
worthy of you who made us all;
cleanse then our hearts, our guilt dispelling,
purify us who heed your call.
'Take this and eat' were words you said;
so do we gather for this bread.
